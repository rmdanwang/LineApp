# LineApp
SEIS 627 (Fall 2019)

LineApp will revolutionize the restaurant waiting and dining experience for both walk-in diners as well as restaurant staffs.  This, free to use, app will allow walk-in diners to be placed on a real-time waitlist with ranking abilities based on the guestâ€™s proximity to the restaurant. The diners will be able to set the size of the party, table preferences, dietary restrictions, as well as any special accommodations. On the other hand, the app will allow restaurants to better organize their waitlist in order to streamline the operations of front of house and increase table turnovers in the dining room, leading to better profits and higher customer satisfaction.
